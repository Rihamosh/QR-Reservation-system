Students attendance, class management and hall reservation system 

U-Attend is a system that consists of a web application and hybrid mobile application that facilitates attendance checking and saves time for both the students and the tutors as opposed to the traditional pen and paper system. This report discusses how the system relies on QR codes to facilitate the attendance taking process. The tutors will display the code from the web application to the students in the hall. Meanwhile, the students will access their mobile applications to scan the code and get their attendance confirmed. 
The tutor’s web application was created using Angular and the mobile application was developed using the Ionic platform. The database used was Firebase, which is a real-time database developed by Google.

This Project is developed by Merna Mohammed Geyoshi, Riham Mhd Kheir and Hadeel Abdullah Abozaid in 2018 and this is our graduation project at Arab Open University.
